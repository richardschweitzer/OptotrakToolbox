The optotrak_sampling_server.m can be used on the Optotrak Host PC to collect Optotrak samples. It is also nicely commented and all parameters can be set according to your liking. The alternative version, using LSL, is optotrak_sampling_server_lsl.m .

It's important to have a 32bit Matlab (for Matlab_to_Optotrak, which is a 32bit mex file) with Psychtoolbox installed on it (because of KbCheck).
