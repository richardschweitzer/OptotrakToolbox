How to use the Northern Digital Optotrak 3D Investigator system in Matlab and get real-time data etc.

CODE etc

01. Matlab_to_Optotrak() Function and the Visual Studio Project files here, based on an idea of Jarrod Blinch (https://motorbehaviour.wordpress.com/2011/09/02/controlling-optotrak-from-matlab/), but vastly extended, e.g., non-blocking routines and rigid body functions.

02. Simple Scripts to run on the Optotrak Server "to try things"

03. Initial scripts to establish the TCP connection between two computers. These are already included in the Optotrak Sampling Server etc. The more advanced way of doing this, is described in LSL.

04. Scripts on how to use the Digital Out of the Datapixx.

05. The OPTOTRAK SAMPLING SERVER.

06. The ROUNDTRIP. Material to understand Optotrak

Recommended introduction using Richard's Optotrak presentation slides: optotrak_presentation_23.08.2016.pdf

Here the Optotrak Programmer's Guide: Optotrak_Application_Programmers_Interface_Guide(IL-1070086).pdf

The Optotrak Certus User Manual (very similar to the one we have in paper) Optotrak_Certus_User_Guide_rev_6(IL-1070106).pdf

First Principles User Guide, although we don't really use First Principles. It's still useful for Alignment, for testing of data sanity, and to see which markers are connected etc. Here: First_Principles_User_Guide(IL-1070104_Rev3).pdf
