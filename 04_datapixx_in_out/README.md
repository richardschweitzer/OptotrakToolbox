There are plenty of cool Datapixx Demos that can be found here: http://www.vpixx.com/manuals/psychtoolbox/html/intro.html

Slighly edited for our setup: DatapixxDoutBasicDemo.m , DatapixxDoutTriggerDemo.m , HitKeyToContinue.m

Most importantly, understand what digital out to trigger and what pin to reach. For the db25 to db9 converter see these specifications: http://www.pccompci.com/rs232-cable-technology.html

Furthermore, one has to know which Digital Out on the Datapixx is connected to which Pin on the db25. See the manual (starting on page 26): PROPixx_UserManual.pdf

Good scripts to play around: DatapixxDoutBasicDemo.m and TTL_trigger_optotrak.m
